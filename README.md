# Bash Boilerplate
A basic template I use to start other Bash scripts.

This was inspired by and is largely a fork of [BASH3 Boilerplate](https://github.com/kvz/bash3boilerplate) but with significant differences in style, structure and some areas of code. It's also a learning project and one that will likely result in many mistakes as it matures, you're probably better off adopting it rather than my variation.
