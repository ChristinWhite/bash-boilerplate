# Bash Boilerplate
A basic template I use to start other Bash scripts.

This is a side project and a work in progress, it's definitely not complete yet. See the Projects tab for more information on what needs to be fixed and what is planned.

This was inspired by and is partially a fork of [BASH3 Boilerplate](https://github.com/kvz/bash3boilerplate) but with significant differences in style, structure and many areas of code.
